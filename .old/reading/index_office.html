        <h2>reading list</h2>
        <p>This list reflects some of the (mostly science-related) things I've been reading lately.</p>

        <h3>biology</h3>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Systems-Biology-Mathematical-Computational/dp/1584886420>
           <u>An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits</u>, Alon (2006)</a>
        </p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computational-Genomics-Studies-Approach/dp/0521671914>
           <u>Introduction to Computational Genomics: A Case Studies Approach</u>, Cristianini & Hahn (2006)</a>
        </p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Ideas-Biology-Dover-Books/dp/0486424197>
           <u>The Ideas of Biology</u>, Bonner, JT (1962)</a>:s
            <br>This is a well-written discussion of some of the fundamental concepts in
                biology. Bonner outlines a rapidly-changing field at a stage in its development
                where big contemporary trends were still beyond the horizon, but
                scientists were beginning to anticipate their existence. An interesting illustration
                of biological principles, and also of the way that science takes shape.</p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Double-Helix-Personal-Discovery-Structure/dp/074321630X>
            <u>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</u>, Watson (1968)</a>

        <p><a href=http://compbio.ucdenver.edu/hunter/01-Hunter.pdf>
            Molecular Biology for Computer Scientists, Hunter (1993)</a>
        </p>

        <h3>mathematics</h3>
        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp/069111966X>
            <u>How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method</u>, Polya (1945)</a>
            <br>Keep it simple!
        </p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Excursions-Number-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486257789>
            <u>Excursions in Number Theory</u>, Ogilvy (1988)</a>
        </p>

        <h3>computing</h3>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/0521692695>
            <u>Programming in Haskell</u>, Hutton (2007)</a>
            <br>When mathematicians study functions, they place a lot of importance
                on carefully characterizing the function's inputs and outputs (in
                particular, the spaces between which the function acts).
                When I was learning to program, I remember getting tripped up by not
                thinking in this way. Then I remember thinking that this kind of
                conceptual structure would make programming so much easier. Then I
                realized that Haskell is built on just this kind of thinking.
