        <p><i>Furthermore, as the sun completes many annual circuits, a finger
            ring is worn thin on the inside; the fall of water drop by drop hollows a
            stone; the curved plowshare, though made of iron, imperceptibly suffers
            attrition in the fields; we see the stone pavements of streets worn away by the
            feet of the crowd; and the bronze statues by city gates display right hands
            rubbed thin by the frequent revential touch of passersby.

        <h3>biology</h3>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Ideas-Biology-Dover-Books/dp/0486424197>
        <u>The Ideas of Biology</u>, Bonner, (1962)</a>
        <br>This is a well-written discussion of some of the big ideas in
            biology. Bonner outlines a rapidly-changing field at a stage in its development
            where big contemporary trends were still beyond the horizon, but
            scientists were beginning to suspect their existence. An interesting illustration
            of biological principles, and also of the way that science takes shape.</p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Double-Helix-Personal-Discovery-Structure/dp/074321630X/>
        <u>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</u>, Watson (1968)</a>
        <br>Like the title says, a first-hand description of how it all went down.
            Readable and interesting both for the science and for the view of science
            in a particular time and place. Notable insights include the
            importance of playing with a (pre-computer) 3d model to discover
            the structure of the DNA molecule, as well as the fact
            that the science basically took place in between going to the pub
            and trying to get invited to dinner parties with attractive European girls.</p>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp/069111966X>

        <u>Excursions in Number Theory</u>, Ogilvy (1988)</a>
        <br>Lots of cool mathematical toys, some of which may appear on this
        website at an indeterminate future point.</p>

        <h3>computing</h3>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/0521692695>
        <u>Programming in Haskell</u>, Hutton (2007)</a>
        <br>When mathematicians study functions, they place a lot of importance
            on characterizing their inputs and outputs (in particular, the
            spaces between which the functions act).
            When I was learning to program, I remember getting tripped up by not
            thinking in this way. Then I remember thinking that this kind of
            conceptual rigor would make programming much easier. Then I
            learned that Haskell is based on just these kinds of ideas.</p>

        <h3>etc</h3>

        <p><a href=http://www.amazon.com/On-Nature-Things-Lucretius/dp/0872205878>
        <u>On the Nature of Things</u>, Lucretius (1st century BC)</a>
        <br>Lucretius more or less predicts the fact that matter is composed of
            atoms, which is amazing. In addition, his description of the theory (as
            well as its encompassing worldview) takes the shape of an incredibly vivid and
            dramatic poem. One of my favorite books ever. Run, don't walk.</p>
